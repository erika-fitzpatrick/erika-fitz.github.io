        Written by the teenage organizers of The March for Our Lives themselves, this book chronicles the students' journeys from the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting through the following weeks of student-led political action and protest, culminating in the March for Our Lives, and then discusses their plans and hopes for the future of the movement. Their first-hand accounts of how they turned their emotions about the mass shooting into hope by organizing one of the largest protests in American history serve as an inspiring guide for young people seeking to enact change, as well as a reminder that you don't need to be old enough to vote to make your voice heard.

There are also chapters that focus on safety and well-being of young activists, including suggestions for prioritizing mental health and self-care in activist spaces, avoiding exploitative relationships with businesses, and preventing ego and jealousy from undermining your work or well-being.

      <h2 class="w3-text-white">about this shelf</h2>
      <p>The "You(th) Can Do Anything!" shelf is a virtual book browsing tool designed for youth in the 11-17 age range and themed around books on youth activism and social change. To provide maximum accessibility and convenience to the target age group, and because the increasing ubiquity of smartphones is making mobile-friendly design useful as an approach to narrowing the technology gap, I felt it was important to use a responsive design when creating this shelf, so that it could easily be used on any device, regardless of screen size. When selecting books for this shelf, I looked to professional reviews from <i>School Library Journal </i>and <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, as well as consumer reviews to gauge general appeal. I also evaluated each of the six titles myself to ensure that they were credible, age-appropriate, and likely to appeal to teens and tweens interested in activism. In an effort both to broaden the appeal of this shelf and maximize exposure to different topics, I selected books that related to the theme from a variety of angles, including climate change, government and politics, gun violence, and art as activism.
      </p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to expand on this by adding additional shelves for other topics and use it on a public library website or as an interactive display on a screen in the library's teen section. Additional links could easily be added to help users figure out where to find the books in the library, put holds on physical books, or check out eBooks and audiobooks. This particular shelf would also be a good fit for a secondary school environment, where it could be used as a themed book display in the school library, or provided by the school librarian to middle or high school teachers as a resource to share in relevant classes, such as civics or environmental science.
