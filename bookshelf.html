        <h5 style='text-align:center'>by Naomi Klein with Rebecca Stefoff
        </br>(2021, Atheneum Books for Young Readers)</h5>
        <i>How to Change Everything</i> is a comprehensive guide to understanding the global implications of climate change and taking action to protect the planet and its people. The book is organized into three sections—“Where We Are,” “How We Got Here,” and “What Happens Next”—and discusses the history of climate change, delving into climate science, climate politics and policies, and climate justice, and then provides actionable solutions to work towards. Filled with inspiring stories of children and teens who have been influential in the climate justice movement, as well as the invaluable wisdom and expertise from renowned activist, professor, and author, Naomi Klein, <i>How to Change Everything</i> is a must-read for the next generation of climate justice activists.

      <h2 class="w3-text-white">about this shelf</h2>
      <p>The "You(th) Can Do Anything!" shelf is a virtual book browsing tool designed for youth in the 11-17 age range and themed around books on youth activism and social change. To provide maximum accessibility and convenience to the target age group, and because the increasing ubiquity of smartphones is making mobile-friendly design useful as an approach to narrowing the technology gap, I felt it was important to use a responsive design when creating this shelf, so that it could easily be used on any device, regardless of screen size. When selecting books for this shelf, I looked to professional reviews from <i>School Library Journal </i>and <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, as well as consumer reviews to gauge general appeal. I also evaluated each of the six titles myself to ensure that they were credible, age-appropriate, and likely to appeal to teens and tweens interested in activism. In an effort both to broaden the appeal of this shelf and maximize exposure to different topics, I selected books that related to the theme from a variety of angles, including climate change, government and politics, gun violence, and art as activism.
      </p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to expand on this by adding additional shelves for other topics and use it on a public library website or as an interactive display on a screen in the library's teen section. Additional links could easily be added to help users figure out where to find the books in the library, put holds on physical books, or check out eBooks and audiobooks. This particular shelf would also be a good fit for a secondary school environment, where it could be used as a themed book display in the school library, or provided by the school librarian to middle or high school teachers as a resource to share in relevant classes, such as civics or environmental science.
